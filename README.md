# About

A simple "RPC over HTTP" application written in Kotlin using Spring Boot.

Used tech stack:

* Spring Boot 2
* JUnit 5, AssertJ, Mockito


## Notes

* Regarding "Provide us with a merge request to master of this repository", it was decided to split each requirement into seperate pull requests/issues.

### Deliberately left out

* Unit and integration tests were not split up (own source paths) in order to keep it as simple as possible for this assignment.
* There are no separate modules (rest, service, persistence) as it would have only unnecessarily increased the complexity.
