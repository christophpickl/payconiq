# About

A simple "RPC over HTTP" application written in Kotlin using Spring Boot.

## Notes

* Regarding "Provide us with a merge request to master of this repository", it was decided to split each requirement into seperate pull requests/issues.
* It was deliberately decided NOT to split unit and integration tests, as I usually would have, in order to keep it as simple as possible for this assignment.
